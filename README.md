RxJava exercises
================
Structure
---------
The exercises are grouped per chapter in the book.

Each chapter starts with 'starters'. The starters are focused exercises
to get familiar with the new material.

After the starters we will work on a small project to apply the new stuff in
a fun context.

Instruction
-----------
The instructions for each chapter start in the test for the starters for that 
chapter. For example, the instructions for chapter 2 start in StartersChapter2Test.
This instructions are written as comments in the tests.

When the tasks in a test are done, then the instructions will 'jump' to the next test.
For example, at the end of StartsChapter2Test, the instructions jump to
ClockControllerTest where the project will start.

Start
-----
Start with StartersChapter2Test and follow the instructions in the test.
